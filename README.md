# OpenUPF

A 3GPP R16 compliant open source UPF.

The OpenUPF is an open source project for 5th generation (5G) mobile core networks User Plane Function. The goal of this project is to implement the User Plane Function (UPF) defined in 3GPP Release 16 (R16) and beyond. 

The software is mainly divided into three units: LBU (load balance unit), SMU (slow match unit) and FPU (fast pass unit).

OpenUPF uses [DPDK](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk.git) to forward packets to acheive high througput.
